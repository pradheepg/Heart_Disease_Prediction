# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on a Kaggle dataset. The dataset used is [Logistic Regression - Heart Disease Prediction]([https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveengowda16/logistic-regression-heart-disease-prediction/code?datasetId=222474)), which includes various features related to heart health.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies for running the code.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pradheepg/Heart_Disease_Prediction.git
    cd Heart_Disease_Prediction
    ```

2. Install dependencies.

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for insights into data analysis and model development.

4. Run the prediction script.

## Model
The heart disease prediction model(Logistic Regression) is implemented using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). The code for the model is available in the Jupyter notebook.

## Usage
To use the heart disease prediction model in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model.
2. Use the `predict` function to get predictions for new data.
